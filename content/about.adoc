This site is dedicated on study materials for the Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 exams. 
Although we try to keep the content up to date we hold no responsibility for any deviations on the actual exam.

After all this webpage was born out of my needs to note down information while studying the certification and it may become stale over time.

For more information about the certification, please visit https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-11-developer/trackp_815[*The official Certification Site*,role=external,window=_blank]
